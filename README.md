# Openfabric-test
This is the front-end of the test by Openfabric i needed to create an Angular application with a responsive layout using Angular Material or Bootstrap. In this case I built an application where the user can buy (future implementation) certain tools for their work, an example would be art's material like pencil.
on the first page the user can see a list of items and their price, the user can click on the three buttons to see more options. A link where it navigates to the description of the page, and an update if they are the ones to create that product (future implementation).


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.
